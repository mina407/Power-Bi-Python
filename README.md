## Overview 
This Project aim to increase sales optimize inconsistent sales performance and customer engagement to understand customer purchasing behavior to optimize markting strategies and improve customer retention and increase overall sales Using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary).
### RFM Model
* The RFM model evaluates customers based on three key metrics:

  - Recency: How recently a customer made a purchase.

  - Frequency: How often a customer makes a purchase.

  - Monetary: How much money a customer spends on purchases.

These metrics are used to score and segment customers into different groups, allowing for targeted marketing strategies.
## Objective
* segment customers into Four different groups to tailor convenient stratgey for each group :
  * VIP Loyal Customers:

    - These are your top-tier customers who consistently make purchases and have a high monetary value. They are highly engaged and loyal to your brand. They often make repeat purchases and are likely to               recommend your products or services to others. Maintaining a strong relationship with this group is crucial, as they contribute significantly to your revenue.

* Potential Loyal Customers:

  - This group consists of customers who have shown interest in your products or services and have made a few purchases. They have the potential to become loyal customers if nurtured properly. Engaging with them     through personalized marketing and excellent customer service can help convert them into VIP Loyal Customers.

* At-Risk Customers:

  - These customers have previously been active but have not made a purchase recently. They may be losing interest in your brand or have found alternatives. It's important to re-engage them with targeted         
    promotions, special offers, or personalized communication to win them back and prevent them from churning.

* Can't Lose Customers:

  - This segment includes customers who have a high monetary value but have not made a purchase in a long time. They are at a high risk of churning, and losing them would significantly impact your revenue.   
   Immediate action is needed to re-engage them, such as offering exclusive deals, loyalty rewards, or personalized outreach to remind them of the value your brand offers.

## Tools Used
* Python
  - Python was used for data processing and RFM segmentation. The following libraries were utilized:

    - pandas for data manipulation
    - datetime for handling date
    - numpy for numerical operations


* Power BI
  - Power
    - BI was used to create interactive dashboards and visualizations to present the RFM segmentation results. The visualizations help in understanding customer segments and making data-driven decisions.
